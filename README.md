## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation:

Until the extension is available from all the repositories and stores, you'll have to set it up manually:

1. Add the lisp files into your Emacs. Sample Doom config:

```elisp
;; packages.el
(package! org-newtab
  :recipe '(:host github :repo "Zweihander-Main/org-newtab"
            :files ("lisp/org-newtab*.el" "LICENSE")))
;; config.el
(use-package! org-newtab-mode)
```

2. Clone this repo and run `pnpm run build` for Chrome, `pnpm run build --target=firefox-mv3` for Firefox.
3. In Chrome, head to `chrome://extensions/`, enabled Developer Mode, and `Load unpacked` the `./build/chrome-mv3-prod` directory.
   In Firefox, head to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and `Load Temporary Add-on` the `./build/firefox-mv3-prod` directory. Note that you'll have to do this every time you restart Firefox until this is on the extension store (soon hopefully!). Alternatively, follow the `web-ext` instructions [from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62237202/firefox-add-ons-how-to-install-my-own-local-add-on-extension-permanently-in-f).
4. `M-x org-newtab-mode`

### Usage:

To control what shows up when a task isn't clocked in, hit the menu button in the top left and change the `Match Query` under the `Behavior` tab. Instructions for creating match queries [can be found here](https://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html).

The background of the item that shows up is controlled by the `org-tag-faces` variable and which tags apply to the item. For now, the assumption is that only one colored tag will be applied to each item.

## Dev Notes

### Technologies used:

-   Emacs:
    -   [Eldev](https://github.com/emacs-eldev/eldev) for project management
    -   [Buttercup](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup/) for testing
    -   [websocket](https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-websocket) and [async](https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async) libs
-   [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) Browser Extension framework
    -   React
    -   TypeScript
    -   Playwright for E2E integration testing
    -   Jest+Runners, Husky+Lint-staged
-   pnpm, eslint, prettier, stylelint

### Misc

-   `chrome.storage.local.get(console.log)` to get extension storage
-   Development is done against Chrome -- there is some flaky behavior when using `pnpm run dev --target=firefox-mv3` though a production build is checked against for every release
